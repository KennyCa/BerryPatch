                    <i> It was a dark and stormy night and our 6 year old Dell crashed for the 20th time while I was desperately trying to print plane tickets. I had done everything possible to limp it along until I could save what I needed to off the dang thing. The 21st time it crashed, it was dead, dead, dead. In what my husband would later refer to as a fit of blinding rage, I dismantled that machine down to 50 itty bitty parts, a box and the hard drive. Only afterwards did I realize that now all of our contacts, tax information, photos, etc was gone. LUCKILY, I work with David's wife and she took the hard drive to David and in short order he saved all of my important items on a flash drive.</i>
